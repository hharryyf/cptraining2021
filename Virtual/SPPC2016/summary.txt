I did this contest in practice mode.

A. Anticlockwise Motion
[solved] This problem is quite simple.
key idea: pattern finding, you can observe what happen if you walk 1 row down and 1 col left from value 1.

B. Balloon Warehouse
[solved] The problem is extremely interesting.
key idea: we need to realize that the final pattern has a period and we only need to consider how the pattern
looks for the first 0 (because it would repeat after the second 0). And we can have some sense of recursive going on.
Hence, if we do a modified dfs and only store the first 1 million visited points we are done.

C. Crazy Rotations
[solved] This problem is standard FFT trick, we can process the 3 letters seperately. 
key idea: put a 1 in position of the processed letter and 0 in other spot, make 1 polynomial with length 2N-1 and other
with length N, then reverse the one with length N and multiply the 2 polynimials.

D. Dendroctonus
[solved] This problem is quite simple, we need some guessing and proving though.
key idea: the center must be one of the following: center of any triangle or center of any segment.

E. Election Frenzy
[solved] This is a standard trick on graph.
key idea: use range tree graph construction trick to build any spanning forest of the origional graph.

I. Intuidiff II
[solved] This problem is not hard at all, just hard to understand what it is trying to say.
key idea: basically, the problem is just asking the maximum weighted subset of non-intersecting segments. This can be solved easily
with a range tree optimization dp.

K. Kiwis vs Kangaroos
[solved] This is a very simple problem.
key idea: just implement the scoring rule and you can solve it.
