We did this contest in team of 3, solved 9 problems during contest and 1 afterward.
This was by far our best performance.

A. Circuits (line sweep, range tree)
[coded by Ali] This problem is quite standard, each rectangle can be viewed as a segment parrallel to the y-axis.
The only regret thing was this problem was not in charged by me :).

B. Cosmetic Survey (floyd, simulation)
[coded by Ali] This problem is standard, the data range is a big hint that we should use floyd. 

C. Disks Arrangement (greedy, simple geometry)
[coded by Ali] Both me and Ali realized that there might be a solution that put the largest one in the middle, smallest, second smallest
on the left, right. We always select the circle from front or back which produce the shortest resulting circles. Don't know how to prove it, 
but it works.

D. Go Latin (simulation)
[coded by Dallas] Login problem.

E. LED (binary search on final answer, line sweep)
[coded by me] We can interpret the problem as use 3 rectangle of height 2 * H to cover all the points. Not hard to use sweeping to validate this H.
But the tricky case is when x = 0, F is strictly 0!!!! 

F. Parentheses (implementation)
[coded by Dallas] Whenever a problem requires implementation, hand it to Dallas is always a good choice :).

G. Secret Code (math, integration, probability)
[coded after contest] This problem is quite hard, especially for someone that has not learned multivariable calculus. The idea is not to write 
and integral based on starting point of B and C, we can write an integral based on the intersection length.

J. Starwars (multi-source BFS)
[coded by Ali] I learned a new trick from this problem. The idea is we can use BFS from the two source clusters. And then use the level order traversal of BFS
to figure out pairs of nodes that contains a valid path from the source. 

K. TV Show Game (2-SAT)
[coded by me] We can easily come up with a set of equations for each constraint. (A or B) and (B or C) and (A or C). The the remaining is 2-SAT.

L. Working Plan (greedy)
[coded by Dallas] The only take away is don't use python in contest unless the input is very small.
