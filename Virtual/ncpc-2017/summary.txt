This is the divisional round of NWERC, but since this is in the European region, this might be interesting.


B. Best Relay Team (simulation)
[solved] A login problem, just enumerate the one that runs first.

D. Distinctive Character (BFS)
[solved] We can interpret the problem as the largest shortest path from multiple source. 

E. Emptying the Baltic (best first search/dijkstra)
[solved] This problem is very standard. The idea is for each point, consider the minimum height cell that can be propagate to that point, this 
is similar to prim/dijkstra algorithm.

G. Galactic Collegiate Programming Contest (dynamic range tree)
[solved] This problem can be easily converted to a kth ordered statistic, but remember, build-in ordered statistic tree doesn't support
multiset, we should use range tree for this. But since there are 2 criterias, we use dynamic range tree and let the point to be point * 1e9 + 5e8 - penalty.

I. Import Spaghetti (floyd)
[solved] This is a standard problem. We just use floyd algorithm to extract the minimum cycle in a directed graph.

J. Judging Moose (simple)
[solved] Login problem, I can solve it in 2010...
