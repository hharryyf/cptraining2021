I solved these problems in practice mode, contest link https://codeforces.com/gym/101398/.

E. Edge Case (pattern finding)
If we realize C5 = 11, we might guess Cn = Cn-1 + Cn-2, and we can write a python script to see if C100 is correct,
and it is. Hence, we solve the problem.


J. Joint Venture (simulation)
Just be careful about the last statement, when there are multiple solutions, abs(l2-l1) maximum is returned.
