I solved these problems in practice mode.

A. Assignments
[solved] this is a stupid problem, make sure no one gets 0 for the contest.

B. Bones’s Battery
[solved] The idea of this problem is you use floyd and binary search on final answer. Quite standard trick.

C. Crusher’s Code
[solved] Just define the "state" as a string with '0' - '7' and we are done. 
The remaining would be a simple expected value dp.

D. Delta Quadrant
[solved] Note that the total cost when K = 0 is 2 times the sum of all weights. Then the problem can be calculated
by a knapsack dp on tree. 

E. Enterprising Escape
[solved] Just a simple dijkstra shortest path.

F. Federation Favorites
[solved] Another stupid problem. Just run a simple sieve and done.

G. Generations of Tribbles
[solved] Another stupid problem. Too simple to be a regional contest problem.

I. Interstellar Trade
[coached by Dallas] I am very bad at solving math construction problems, and I met one :(. Let mid be (min(x) + max(x))/2
we claim that the wormhole is placed like this [L     h1     x1  mid         x2  h2  R].

K. Klingons
[solved] This problem is the well-known tree isomorphism which can be done by dfs and encode the tree as '(node(subtree))'.
Then use double-hashing to do the pattern matching. 

L. Languages
[solved] Just make sure you read the problem statement clearly, then apply string parsing template and done.

M. Mass Production
[solved] The idea is we can think the procedure as the target items transform back to the base type and then transform
to class B items. And to model this procedure, what's better than MCMF? I'm actually quite confused on why so little
people solve this problem in contest?
