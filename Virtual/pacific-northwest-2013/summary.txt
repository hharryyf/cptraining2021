I solved these problems in practice mode.

A. Assignments
[solved] this is a stupid problem, make sure no one gets 0 for the contest.

B. Bones’s Battery
[solved] The idea of this problem is you use floyd and binary search on final answer. Quite standard trick.

C. Crusher’s Code
[solved] Just define the "state" as a string of length 8 and we are done. The remaining would be a simple
expected value dp.

E. Enterprising Escape
[solved] Just a simple dijkstra shortest path.

F. Federation Favorites
[solved] Another stupid problem. Just run a simple sieve and done.

G. Generations of Tribbles
[solved] Another stupid problem. Too simple to be a regional contest problem.

L. Languages
[solved] Just make sure you read the problem statement clearly, then apply string parsing template and done.

M. Mass Production
[solved] The idea is we can think the procedure as the target items transform back to the base type and then transform
to class B items. And to model this procedure, what's better than MCMF? I'm actually quite confused on why so little
people solve this problem in contest?
